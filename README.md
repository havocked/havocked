# Hey, I'm Nate 👋

Programmer based in Leipzig, Germany. Background in iOS (Swift/Obj-C), now building **CLI-first tools** and exploring **AI-powered workflows**.

I believe the best tools are composable, verifiable, and automatable — no manual steps left hanging.

## What I'm Building

🎵 **[tidal-cli](https://github.com/havocked/tidal-cli)** — Control the TIDAL desktop app from the terminal. TypeScript, Chrome DevTools Protocol, zero auth overhead. Search, play, manage playlists — all pipeable.

🎧 **[curator](https://github.com/havocked/curator)** — CLI toolkit for intelligent playlist curation. Genre discovery via MusicBrainz, energy-arc arrangements, provider-agnostic design. Pairs with tidal-cli.

Together they form a composable music pipeline: `curator discover --genre jazz | tidal playlist create "Late Night Jazz"`

## Philosophy

```
Every tool should be composable (pipe-friendly, CLI-first)
Every action should be verifiable (did it work? show me)
Every workflow should be automatable (no manual steps left hanging)
```
